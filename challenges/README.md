# React Hooks workshop challenges

This directory contains challenges to practice using React Hooks.

## Installation

Before you start, make sure you have Node (10.x or above) and npm installed (5.2 or above).

Then, install the project's dependencies using the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the application

To run the application, invoke:

```sh
npm start
```

This command will build the app and open it in a new browser tab.

## Testing

Some challenges contain unit tests that fully test the correctness of your solution.

Run:

```sh
npm run test
```

to run the tests in watch mode. Errors will be reported to the console after every edit.
