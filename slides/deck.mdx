# React Hooks

Author: Grzegorz Rozdzialik

## Agenda

1. What are React Hooks?
2. Kinds of hooks
3. Rules of hooks
4. Adding functionality (**class** vs **function** components)
5. Code challenges

---

## What are React Hooks?

- a way to add functionality to function components
- a measure for easy code reuse between components
- a new mental model for creating React components
- a way of Facebook saying FU to class components ðŸ˜„

---

## Rationale

1. Sharing stateful logic between components is hard
2. Classes are supposedly confusing to developers

```notes
1. One would have to use higher order components or render props

    They have their own problems (i.e. introduce new components into the component tree,
    problems with typing in Typescript)

    Moreover copying and pasting code that uses component's state required dilligence
    and copying code from multiple sources.

2. Public/private members, methods vs properties, binding functions, knowing and remembering how
    `this` works - it adds up.

    There are some technical reasons for abandoning classes:
    * not well minified
    * components cannot be folded (with Prepack)
    * verbose code
```
